# Motivation

Google sheets are great for personal finance, but I found once they
hit a certain complexity adding additional features became a pain.
I also recently found out that heroku hosts flask and dash apps for
free.  I originally started with flask (which I was familiar with)
and plotly, and I quickly remembered how frustrating that process
can be.  I decided this might be an opportunity to try out dash.
