# Plot Descriptions

## Balance Over Time

This plot demonstrates the original motivation for PFF.  Income is not split among different balances; everything is combined.  This plot
shows that balance over time (age).

There are multiple ways to use this graph.  The most obvious is to
determine whether retirement balances will last a sufficient amount
of time.  A user interested in reaching a certain balance can also
look here.

## Income Over Time

The different defined income types are displayed over time.  This
is helpful to see how they increase over time and their relative
contributions.

## Expenses Over Time

Same as Income Over Time but for expenses.
